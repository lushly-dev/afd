# Umbel status

Read this before anything else in the area, and update it before you end a
session that changed Umbel. It is the source of truth for progress: an agent
should never have to scan the codebase to learn what is current.

## How to keep this file

- **Say exactly what is done and exactly what is not.** "Done" means merged
  to `main` with evidence linked: a pull request, a commit, a passing check.
  Anything else is "in progress" or "open" with what remains spelled out.
- **Record how you verified it**: the command or check, and the date.
- **Write down follow-ups that are not yet issues.** If a future agent must
  know it but nobody owns it yet, it goes in the follow-ups table with a date
  and who raised it. Promote it to an issue when it gets an owner, and link
  the issue here.
- **Never delete history.** Mark an entry superseded and point to what
  replaced it.
- **Every phase specification carries the same block**: state, last verified
  with date and evidence, done, not done, follow-ups. This file aggregates
  those blocks; the phase folder holds the detail (decisions D20 and D24).
- **Dates are absolute.** Never "last week".

## Phase detail

### AFD prerequisites

- **State:** not started.
- **Done:** nothing.
- **Not done:** every row of the
  [prerequisites table](architecture.md#afd-prerequisites). Phase 0 needs the
  Rust lazy and grouped strategies, meta-tools and AFD contexts (language
  parity D1), Rust structured content and output schemas (#465), a
  per-request context hook on the Rust MCP server and the hybrid strategy as
  an AFD feature (D27), required: its
  [proposal](../../../docs/features/proposed/hybrid-tool-strategy/hybrid-tool-strategy.proposal.md) is written and awaits the owner's review; its spec step
  comes first and its Rust step builds on language parity D1.
- **Note:** the hybrid strategy, resources, prompts, the Skills over MCP
  extension and output budgets are AFD-wide features; each needs a
  `docs/features` proposal, spec first, before Rust implements it (D25).

### Phase 0. Host skeleton

- **State:** not started.
- **Done:** nothing.
- **Not done:** everything in the phase 0 row of the architecture.

Phases 1 to 7 have no detail yet; add a heading in this shape when one
starts.

## Follow-ups not yet issues

| Date | Raised by | Follow-up | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-10-30 | Design session | Land the phase 0 prerequisites in `packages/rust`; the lazy strategy, meta-tools and contexts are already parity item D1 and #465 is open | Open |
| 2026-10-30 | Design session | Decide the execution model, open decision O2 | Done 2026-10-31: the owner chose the hybrid strategy, recorded as [D27](decisions.md) in [#522](https://github.com/lushly-dev/afd/pull/522), open until merged |
| 2026-10-30 | Design session | Decide the first external integration, open decision O1; it sets the connector contract | Open, owner's decision |
| 2026-10-30 | Design session | When crates land, add `umbel` to the families in `architecture.json` and to the release inventory under `endpoints/umbel/` (D21); units start quarantined | Open |
| 2026-10-30 | Design session | Harness channels must negotiate MCP 2025-11-25 or earlier; keep the SDK's compatibility on push paths and re-check watchlist row W15 | Open |
| 2026-10-30 | Design session | Refresh the trajectory watchlist rows before each phase specification, in particular W2 and W3 ahead of 2027-03-30 | Open, recurring |
| 2026-10-30 | End-to-end review | Write `docs/features` proposals, spec first, for the hybrid tool strategy, for resources, prompts and Skills over MCP in AFD servers reconciled with the Skill Knowledge Layer, and for per-tool output budgets | Open. Hybrid tool strategy: [proposal](../../../docs/features/proposed/hybrid-tool-strategy/hybrid-tool-strategy.proposal.md) written 2026-10-31, awaiting the owner's review; the other two not started |
| 2026-10-30 | End-to-end review | Reconcile vocabulary and the proposal record with the Agent Engine proposal, whose modules are Umbel's plugins and whose loop overlaps the curator | Open |
| 2026-10-30 | End-to-end review | Over MCP, the Rust approval middleware includes approval tokens by default; Umbel must turn that off on the MCP path. Re-checked 2026-10-31: [#518](https://github.com/lushly-dev/afd/pull/518) closed #460 with the private in-process exchange, and the default on the MCP path is unchanged | Open |

## Session log

| Date | Session | What changed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-10-30 | Design session with the owner | Proposal, research and sources written and merged ([#491](https://github.com/lushly-dev/afd/pull/491)); name decided; diagrams, trajectory watch, trajectory reservations, decisions D13 to D20 and this status file in [#493](https://github.com/lushly-dev/afd/pull/493), merged |
| 2026-10-30 | End-to-end review | Three independent reviews and a verification pass. Moved the area from `umbel/` to `endpoints/umbel/` (D21 supersedes D6). Command names brought into AFD's rule (D22); glossary (D23); phase specification path and approval (D24); AFD-first map and prerequisites table (D25); open decisions numbered O1 to O5. Principal moved onto AFD's actor and credentials; event log defined as a journal projection; candidates moved from the host to the curator; permission filtering moved into the store query; memory classes clarified; Skills given three delivery paths; Open Knowledge Format updated to v0.2; library versions and Rust 1.97 recorded; retrieval figures, SharePoint, Codex, events and authorization claims corrected. #493 had merged at its earlier head, so these went in [#516](https://github.com/lushly-dev/afd/pull/516), merged |
| 2026-10-30 | Design session with the owner | Spaces added at the owner's request: isolated knowledge bases inside one deployment (principle 16, D26), with the three levels of coupling in the architecture's data and content section, per-space phases and glossary entries; O5 narrowed to tenancy beyond spaces. [#516](https://github.com/lushly-dev/afd/pull/516), merged |
| 2026-10-31 | Handoff check | Re-checked every document against `main` before handoff. Pull request states corrected: #493 and #516 merged, and D21 to D26 came in #516. [#518](https://github.com/lushly-dev/afd/pull/518) closed #460 and gave Rust the private in-process approval exchange, so the approval rows now name only the MCP approval relay, which language parity tracks without an issue yet. The rmcp prerequisite was removed: the crate commits no lock, and its 3.7 requirement already resolves 3.8.0. Links, anchors and every D, O, R, W and S reference resolve. [#519](https://github.com/lushly-dev/afd/pull/519) |
| 2026-10-31 | Execution-model decision | The owner decided O2: the hybrid strategy, with code mode later and optional, recorded as D27. O2 references in the proposal, architecture and this file now point at D27; the hybrid prerequisite is required for phase 0. Wrote the AFD [hybrid tool strategy proposal](../../../docs/features/proposed/hybrid-tool-strategy/hybrid-tool-strategy.proposal.md) with its status file; no `spec/` or code changes. Links and anchors checked. [#522](https://github.com/lushly-dev/afd/pull/522), open |
