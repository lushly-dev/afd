## 📢 Announcing: Agentic AI UX Design Principles Framework (Draft)

**Lead:** Jason Falk
**Status:** ⚪ Initial Draft Set Completed

Hi team,

Responding to feedback from our recent Signals survey requesting more AI training and resources, I'm sharing the initial **draft** of the **Agentic AI UX Design Principles Framework**.

**Context:** This framework addresses the need for standardized UX principles to guide the design of emerging agentic AI experiences.

**Solution & Impact:** It provides a comprehensive set of documents covering key attributes, UI patterns, interaction models, communication styles, trust & safety, evaluation, and implementation strategies. The goal is to establish a shared vocabulary and foundational guidance to help us design more effective, consistent, and user-centered agentic AI features, ultimately improving usability and user trust.

**Description:** This initial draft framework consists of nine interconnected documents covering foundational aspects of UX design for agentic AI. It defines core concepts like agent attributes (autonomy, proactivity), outlines necessary UI affordances (e.g., control mechanisms, transparency features), explores different agent-application interaction models, provides communication style guidance, addresses trust and safety concerns, and offers methods for evaluation and implementation.
