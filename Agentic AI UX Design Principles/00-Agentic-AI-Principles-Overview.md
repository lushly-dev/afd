## What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can act independently on behalf of users to accomplish tasks, make decisions, and achieve goals. Unlike traditional AI that simply responds to direct commands, agentic AI can take initiative, maintain context over time, and operate across multiple systems to complete complex objectives.

In the context of UX design, agentic AI represents a fundamental shift from tools that users directly manipulate to assistants that users collaborate with. This unique human-agent relationship unlocks significant user value by enabling people to tackle more complex, ambiguous, or long-running goals than previously possible. However, it also introduces critical user risks if not designed carefully, such as loss of agency, confusion about capabilities, eroded trust, and unpredictable outcomes. Navigating the inherent tensions—balancing AI autonomy with user control, communicating capabilities clearly, and designing for effective collaboration—is the core challenge this framework aims to address for UX practitioners.

As AI capabilities advance, these systems are evolving from simple chatbots to sophisticated agents that can understand complex goals, develop multi-step plans, and execute actions across various applications and services. This evolution requires new design approaches that go beyond traditional interface paradigms.

## Introduction

This framework provides guidance for designing user experiences with agentic AI systems - AI that can act independently on behalf of users. As AI agents become more integrated into digital products, designers need clear principles to ensure these powerful systems enhance user capabilities while remaining trustworthy, understandable, and controllable. Effectively managing the delicate balance between agent autonomy and user control, transparency and efficiency, and proactivity and predictability is paramount for creating successful agentic experiences.

## Framework scope

- **Core attributes**: The fundamental characteristics that define agentic AI experiences
- **Interface design**: Conceptual elements needed for effective human-agent collaboration
- **Technical implementation**: Methods for integrating agents with applications and systems
- **Communication design**: Principles for agent voice, tone, and interaction patterns
- **Integration patterns**: Approaches for embedding agents beyond conversational interfaces
- **Ethical considerations**: Guidelines for responsible development of autonomous systems

## Audience

This framework is intended for:

- **UX designers** working on products that incorporate agentic AI capabilities
- **UX engineers** implementing agent interactions
- **Researchers** exploring new paradigms for human-AI collaboration
- **Product managers** planning and prioritizing AI features

The principles are adaptable across different domains and product types, from productivity tools to creative applications, enterprise software to consumer services.

## Document guide

This framework consists of the following documents:

1. **Key Attributes of Agentic Experiences** - Defines the essential characteristics that distinguish truly agentic systems from basic AI implementations.

2. **UI Affordances and Patterns** - Outlines the interface elements and design patterns needed for effective human-agent collaboration.

3. **Agent-Application Interaction Methods** - Explores different approaches for how agents can interact with applications and their respective tradeoffs.

4. **Interaction Styles and Communication** - Offers guidelines for effective agent communication, including consistency, clarity, and adaptability.

5. **Experiences Beyond Conversation** - Describes how to integrate agentic capabilities into applications beyond conversational interfaces.

6. **Trust and Safety Framework** - Addresses dimensions of trust in agentic systems and safety mechanisms to protect users.

7. **Business Requirements and Prioritization** - Provides a catalog of requirements and implementation prioritization framework.

8. **Evaluation Methods and Metrics** - Provides methods and metrics for evaluating agentic experiences across different dimensions.

9. **Implementation Strategy and Roadmap** - Outlines implementation phases, prioritization frameworks, and technical considerations.


## How to use this framework

Each document can be used independently based on your specific needs:

- **Product managers**: Focus on key attributes, business requirements, and implementation strategy
- **UX designers**: Refer to UI affordances, interaction styles, and experiences beyond conversation
- **Developers**: Explore interaction methods and implementation strategy
- **Researchers**: Review trust and safety considerations and evaluation methods

This is a living framework that will evolve as our understanding of agentic AI design matures.
