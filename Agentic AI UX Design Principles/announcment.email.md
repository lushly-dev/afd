Subject: Now Available: Agentic AI UX Design Principles Framework (Draft)

Hi team,

During our last Signals survey, many of you expressed a desire for more AI training and resources. As part of our effort to address this, I've been working on consolidating UX design principles specifically for agentic AI experiences, and I'm happy to share the initial draft documentation with you today.

This framework is intended to provide guidance for designing AI systems that can act autonomously on behalf of users while maintaining trust, safety, and usability. Understanding and applying these principles will help us create more effective and user-centered agentic features.

**Please note:** These documents are currently in **draft** form. Your feedback is highly encouraged! Please review them when you have a chance and share any suggestions, questions, or areas you think are missing.

The currently available documents in the series include:

*   **01-Agentic-AI-Key-Attributes.md**: Defines the core, enhancing, and contextual attributes of agentic AI.
*   **02-Agentic-AI-UI-Affordances-and-Patterns.md**: Details the UI elements and patterns needed to support agentic interactions.
*   **03-Agentic-AI-Agent-Application-Interaction.md**: Discusses various models for how agents can interact with applications.
*   **04-Agentic-AI-Interaction-Styles-and-Communication.md**: Covers principles for effective agent voice, tone, and communication style.
*   **05-Agentic-AI-Experiences-Beyond-Conversation.md**: Explores integrating agentic capabilities directly into application UIs.
*   **06-Agentic-AI-Trust-and-Safety.md**: Focuses on building user trust and implementing safety mechanisms.
*   **07-Agentic-AI-Business-Requirements-and-Prioritization.md**: Outlines necessary business requirements and suggests an implementation prioritization.
*   **08-Agentic-AI-Evaluation-Methods-and-Metrics.md**: Provides guidance on evaluating the effectiveness of agentic systems.
*   **09-Agentic-AI-Implementation-Strategy-and-Roadmap.md**: Discusses strategic considerations for implementing agentic features.

Please take some time to familiarize yourself with these principles. They represent a valuable starting point as we continue to explore and build agentic AI experiences. Given the rapid pace of change in AI, we plan for this to be a living document, updated over time to stay current.

Thanks,
