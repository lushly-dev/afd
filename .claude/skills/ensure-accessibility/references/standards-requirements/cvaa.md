# CVAA-Oriented Accessibility Guidance

Connect accessibility issues to the 21st Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act and FCC accessibility rules.

## Scope

Use this guidance when:

- The product is a communications platform (messaging, VoIP, video conferencing) or video programming service.
- The question involves captions, audio description, emergency information, or device user interfaces for communications/media.
- The service or product is within FCC jurisdiction (U.S. telco, cable/streaming, communications hardware).

If the main concern is a general website or app that is not primarily a communications or video service, WCAG/ADA/508 may be more appropriate.

## Key Concepts

- **Communications accessibility**: Advanced communications services and video conferencing must be accessible and usable by people with disabilities, where readily achievable.
- **Video programming**: IP-delivered video programming must include closed captions; certain content has audio description obligations. Devices used to view video must provide accessible UIs.
- **Device and UI**: Hardware and software for communications/video must provide accessible controls and status feedback, overlapping with WCAG principles and EN 301 549 hardware requirements.

## How to Apply in Reviews

1. Clarify whether the product provides communications, video programming, or both.
2. For communications UIs, map to WCAG criteria for operable controls, focus management, text alternatives, and status messages.
3. For video, focus on caption availability/quality, audio description, and accessible playback controls.
4. Highlight overlap with WCAG and EN 301 549.

All guidance is informational only, not legal or regulatory advice.

## Common Mistakes

- Applying CVAA framing to experiences that are not primarily communications or video services.
- Focusing only on captions/audio description while ignoring player/UI operability.
- Missing device and non-web UI implications.
- Offering FCC/legal interpretations instead of technical guidance.
