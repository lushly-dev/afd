# ADA Title II / Title III-Oriented Accessibility Guidance

Connect accessibility issues to ADA expectations for state/local governments (Title II) and public accommodations (Title III).

## Scope

Use this guidance when:

- The entity is a U.S. state or local government (Title II).
- The entity is a private business or nonprofit open to the public (Title III).
- The question is about websites, mobile apps, portals, online forms, or digital services reaching the U.S. public.

If the entity is a U.S. federal agency, pivot to Section 508 guidance instead.

## Key Concepts

- **Title II** (Public entities): State/local governments. DOJ's 2024 rule requires most web content and mobile apps to conform to WCAG 2.1 Level AA.
  - Large entities (population 50,000+): April 24, 2026 deadline.
  - Small entities (population 0-49,999): April 26, 2027 deadline.
- **Title III** (Public accommodations): Private entities open to the public. WCAG 2.1 AA is the de facto benchmark in DOJ settlements and litigation.
- **WCAG as the practical target**: For Title II, now explicitly required. For Title III, the safest risk-reduction strategy.

## How to Apply in Reviews

1. Clarify entity type and digital surfaces in scope.
2. Map issues to WCAG 2.1 AA criteria first.
3. Explain Title II vs Title III implications in plain language.
4. Highlight effective communication and alternate access obligations.

All guidance is informational only, not legal advice.

## Common Mistakes

- Treating ADA context as a definitive legal conclusion.
- Failing to distinguish Title II vs Title III scenarios.
- Focusing on policy framing without mapping to concrete WCAG issues.
- Omitting alternate access considerations when remediation will take time.
