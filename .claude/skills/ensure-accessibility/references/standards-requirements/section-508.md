# Section 508-Oriented Accessibility Guidance

Connect accessibility issues to U.S. federal Section 508 obligations for electronic and information technology.

## Scope

Use this guidance when:

- The entity is a U.S. federal agency or is selling products/services to federal agencies.
- The question involves federal websites, applications, documents, hardware, or platforms.
- The user mentions VPATs, ACRs, Section508.gov, Trusted Tester, or OMB M-24-08.

If the entity is state/local government or a private public accommodation, pivot to ADA guidance instead.

## Key Concepts

- **Who is covered**: Federal agencies' development, procurement, maintenance, and use of EIT. Also affects vendors evaluated by federal buyers.
- **Technical baseline**: Binding standard references WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA for web and software. Many agencies treat WCAG 2.1 AA as de facto expectation.
- **Documentation**: VPAT/ACR is the standard for vendor conformance documentation. ICT Testing Baselines and DHS Trusted Tester are widely used evaluation methods.
- **OMB M-24-08**: Pushes agencies to build strong Section 508 programs, publish accessibility statements, and monitor digital properties.

## How to Apply in Reviews

1. Clarify whether looking at agency ICT or vendor products.
2. Map issues to WCAG and 508 provisions, describing how they would appear in ACR rows.
3. Highlight program and procurement implications.
4. Encourage alignment with WCAG 2.1 AA where feasible for new work.

All guidance is informational only, not legal or procurement advice.

## Common Mistakes

- Applying Section 508 to the wrong entity type (state/local should use ADA framing).
- Stating WCAG 2.1 AA as the legal 508 baseline (binding reference is WCAG 2.0 AA).
- Ignoring VPAT/ACR implications.
- Skipping coordination guidance (Section 508 program office, acquisition, legal).
