# European Accessibility Act (EAA)-Oriented Accessibility Guidance

Connect accessibility issues to the EAA, harmonizing requirements for products and services across the EU.

## Scope

Use this guidance when:

- The product or service is offered to consumers in the EU/EEA (including by non-EU companies).
- The in-scope item is EAA-covered: computers, smartphones, tablets, e-readers, ATMs, ticketing machines, consumer banking, e-commerce, passenger transport info, e-books, or certain media services.

## Key Concepts

- **Products + services**: The EAA covers both physical products and digital services, including UI, documentation, packaging, support, and contracts.
- **Technical standard**: EN 301 549 is the primary harmonized standard. For digital content, that means WCAG 2.1 AA.
- **Timeline**: June 28, 2025 is the main application date for new products/services. Transitional window for pre-2025 products extends to June 28, 2030. Self-service terminals in use before June 2025 can remain for up to 20 years.

## How to Apply in Reviews

1. Clarify product vs service and in-market timing.
2. Anchor issues in EN 301 549 / WCAG 2.1 AA.
3. Address the "2030 myth" -- new products/services after June 2025 should already be accessible.
4. Highlight cross-law synergies with Section 508 and ADA Title II.

All guidance is informational only, not legal advice.

## Common Mistakes

- Assuming EAA only applies to websites (it covers products and services).
- Treating 2030 as a blanket safe date.
- Not clarifying product vs service and market timing.
- Presenting EAA guidance as legal advice rather than informational mapping.
