# Publish Python Package to PyPI
#
# Triggers on:
#   - GitHub Release (manual, for major releases)
#   - Tag push matching 'python-v*' (e.g., python-v0.1.2)
#
# Uses PyPI Trusted Publishing (OIDC) - no API tokens needed!
#
# Setup required on PyPI:
#   1. Go to https://pypi.org/manage/project/afd/settings/publishing/
#   2. Add a new trusted publisher:
#      - Owner: lushly-dev
#      - Repository: AFD
#      - Workflow: publish-python.yml
#      - Environment: (leave blank for no environment)
