Internal peer dependencies now publish as caret ranges. `@lushly-dev/afd-auth` peers on `@lushly-dev/afd-server` `^X.Y.Z` and `@lushly-dev/afd-view-state` peers on `@lushly-dev/local-db` `^X.Y.Z`, where each previously required that exact version. `@lushly-dev/afd-adapters` peers on `@lushly-dev/afd-core` `^X.Y.Z` instead of `>=2.0.0`, so a future major of afd-core is no longer accepted without a matching adapters release.
