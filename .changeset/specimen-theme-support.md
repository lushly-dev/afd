Declared and observed theme support. A story declares the themes it supports with a `light-only`, `dark-only` or `high-contrast-only` tag on itself or its meta, and a native specimen with `themes: { supported, reason? }` in the configuration; the entry carries it as `themes`. The review page tags a declared entry on the index and the preview, and when the selected theme is one it does not support, says so above the frame instead of looking like a broken switch. `bench.themes()`, `specimen-themes` and `specimen themes [ID]` render entries in each theme and compare the screenshots, reporting each as `follows`, `declared`, `pinned`, `undeclared`, `contradicted` or `unavailable`; `valid` is false, and the CLI exits 1, when one is `undeclared`. A component pack record can carry an optional `themes` fact, `declared` or `observed`, and a pack build writes a declared one when every case about a component declares the same themes; a reader from before this change refuses a record that carries it. The review page's shell ceiling moves from 50,000 to 52,000 bytes, since the shell's own code is 49,793.
