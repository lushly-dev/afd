Build component packs: a `pack` configuration key names the library, and `bench.pack()`, `bench.packCheck()` and `bench.packExport()` build its committed form from two passes over every case, compare a build with the committed records, and write the exported form with no browser. A case that fails, after one retry, or shows something different in each pass contributes nothing; an example is kept only when its markup, mounted on its own, shows the same. Export refuses, naming the record, when the manifest or a guide file says something the committed records do not, and keeps other libraries and a deployment's `pack.toml`. Guide files take `roles` for states a capture does not show. The example pack's records changed: a boolean attribute no longer lists `true` and `false`, and `example-option`'s `value` is observed.

The commands are `specimen-pack`, `specimen-pack-check` and `specimen-pack-export` in `@lushly-dev/specimen-afd`, and `specimen pack [TAG]`, `pack-check [TAG]` and `pack-export DIR` in the CLI. With a component, a build rebuilds that one record from the cases the last full build indexed (a cache under `node_modules/.cache/specimen/`), when the bench bundle is unchanged since; otherwise every case runs and the report says why. `pack-check` exits 1 when a committed record differs or a case failed.
