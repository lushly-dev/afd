# AFD - Agent-First Development

> ⚠️ **Alpha Status** — This project is under active development. APIs and patterns may change. Feedback welcome!

A methodology and toolkit for building software where AI agents are first-class users.

## Philosophy: UX Design for AI Collaborators

AFD treats AI agents the way UX designers treat human users: as collaborators deserving thoughtful, friction-free experiences.

Traditional apps are **opaque to AI**—capabilities locked behind visual interfaces, state hidden in UI components, features that only work through mouse clicks. An LLM with terminal access is like a brilliant engineer who can only interact through a keyhole.

**AFD inverts this.** Commands ARE the application. The UI becomes optional—a view layer that can be swapped, simplified, or removed entirely as AI handles more of the "understanding intent" work.

This enables:
- **Fearless experimentation** — Change UI radically without touching business logic
- **Future-proof architecture** — Same commands work for CLI, GUI, chat, voice, whatever comes next
- **Human-AI collaboration** — Shared command language both can understand and verify
- **Reductive design** — Systematically remove UI friction as AI capabilities grow

## The Problem

Traditional software development treats agent/API access as an afterthought:

```
Traditional Flow:
  Build UI → Extract API → Expose to Agents (maybe)
```

This leads to:
- Inconsistent behavior between UI and agent interactions
- Features that only work through the UI
- Agents that can't fully utilize the software
- Fragile integrations that break when UI changes

## The Solution: Agent-First Development

AFD inverts the development flow:

```
Agent-First Flow:
  Define Commands → Validate via CLI → Build UI Surface
```

**The command layer IS the product.** UI is just one of many possible surfaces.

## Core Principles

### 1. Command-First

All application functionality is exposed as **commands** (tools) with well-defined schemas:

```typescript
// Every action is a command
const createDocument = {
  name: 'document.create',
  description: 'Creates a new document',
  schema: {
    title: { type: 'string', required: true },
    content: { type: 'string', required: false }
  },
  handler: async (args) => { /* ... */ }
};
```

### 2. CLI Validation

Before building any UI, validate commands work via CLI:

```bash
# Test the command directly
afd call document.create --title "My Document"

# Verify it worked
afd call document.list
```

If it doesn't work via CLI, **don't build UI for it**.

### 3. The Honesty Check

> "If it can't be done via CLI, the architecture is wrong."

The CLI becomes a quality gate:
- Forces proper abstraction
- Ensures all actions are centralized
- Prevents UI-only code paths
- Enables automation and testing

### 4. Dual Interface

The same commands power both humans and agents:

### 5. UX-Enabling Schemas

Commands should return data that enables good agent UX:

```typescript
interface CommandResult<T> {
  success: boolean;
  data?: T;
  error?: CommandError;
  
  // UX-enabling fields
  confidence?: number;      // Enables confidence indicators
  reasoning?: string;       // Enables transparency ("why did the agent do this?")
  sources?: Source[];       // Enables source attribution
  plan?: PlanStep[];        // Enables plan visualization
  alternatives?: T[];       // Enables user choice
}
```

See [Command Schema Guide](./.claude/skills/afd/references/command-schema.md) for detailed patterns.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              Command Registry                    │
│  (Single source of truth for all actions)       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
        ▲               ▲               ▲
        │               │               │
   ┌────┴────┐    ┌────┴────┐    ┌────┴────┐
   │   UI    │    │   CLI   │    │   MCP   │
   │ (Human) │    │ (Dev)   │    │ (Agent) │
   └─────────┘    └─────────┘    └─────────┘
```

## Development Workflow

**Per-Command Workflow** (repeat for each feature):

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Step 1: DEFINE                                 │
│  • Create command with schema                   │
│  • Register in command registry                 │
│  • Document inputs, outputs, side effects       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Step 2: VALIDATE                               │
│  • Test via CLI: afd call <command>             │
│  • Cover edge cases and error states            │
│  • Add automated tests (Vitest)                 │
│  • Do NOT proceed until CLI works            │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Step 3: SURFACE                                │
│  • Build UI component that invokes command      │
│  • UI is a thin wrapper, not business logic     │
│  • Integration test (Playwright)                │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

> **Note**: This is the per-command workflow. For the full 4-phase **project implementation roadmap** (Foundation → Expansion → Refinement → Ecosystem), see [Implementation Phases](./.claude/skills/afd-developer/references/implementation-phases.md).

## Why "Agent-First"?

The term **"Agent"** is intentionally technology-agnostic:

- **MCP** (Model Context Protocol) is today's standard
- **Function Calling** is another approach
- **Future protocols** will emerge

But the concept of an **autonomous agent** that can use your software remains constant—just like "Person" describes a human regardless of what tools they use.

By designing for agents first, your software automatically becomes:
- API-first (agents need APIs)
- Well-documented (agents need schemas)
- Testable (agents need predictable behavior)
- Automatable (agents ARE automation)

## Enabling Good Agent UX

AFD isn't just about making software work for agents—it's about enabling **good** agent experiences. Well-designed commands build user trust:

| UX Principle | How AFD Enables It |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **Competence Trust** | CLI-validated commands prove reliability |
| **Transparency** | Commands return `reasoning` and `sources` |
| **Plan Visibility** | Commands return `plan` with steps |
| **Confidence Calibration** | Commands return `confidence` scores |
| **Control & Intervention** | Commands are atomic, cancellable units |
| **Error Recovery** | Commands have standardized, actionable errors |

See [Trust Through Validation](./.claude/skills/afd-developer/references/trust-validation.md) for the full trust framework.

## Testing

AFD emphasizes testability at every layer. Run the full test suite:

```bash
pnpm test
```

### Test Categories

| Category | Purpose | Location |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Unit Tests** | Command logic correctness | `**/commands/__tests__/commands.test.ts` |
| **Performance Tests** | Response time baselines | `**/commands/__tests__/performance.test.ts` |
| **AFD Compliance** | CommandResult structure validation | Included in unit tests |

### Performance Testing

Performance tests establish baselines and detect regressions:

```bash
# Run with performance summary
pnpm test

# Example output:
# Performance Summary
# Command             Duration    Threshold   Status
# todo.create         0.85ms      10ms        ✓
# todo.list           8.7ms       20ms        ✓
```

Commands are tested in isolation (no network, no database) to measure pure business logic performance. See the Todo example for patterns.
